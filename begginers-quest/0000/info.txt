there is a simple ceaser cipher (13 chars) 
	Anyway, Caesar was a skilled communicator, and he used a variety of methods to keep his messages secret from his enemies. One of these methods was the Caesar cipher, a simple technique to obfuscate communications. FLAG{rotate_that_alphabet}

honestly idk, gonna back to it xD
got this, its vigenere cipher
	the vigenere cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher it is a more sophisticated version of the caesar cipher which uses a single shift value to encrypt the entire message flag get viggy with it

THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG. THIS TEXT IS A PANGRAM, WHICH MEANS THAT IT CONTAINS ALL 26 LETTERS OF THE ENGLISH ALPHABET. THIS MAKES IT IDEAL FOR FREQUENCY ANALYSIS, AS THE CRYPTANALYST CAN COMPARE THE FREQUENCY OF LETTERS IN THE CIPHERTEXT TO THE KNOWN FREQUENCY OF LETTERS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MOST COMMON LETTER IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS E. IF THE MOST COMMON LETTER IN THE CIPHERTEXT IS X, THEN THE CRYPTANALYST CAN ASSUME THAT X IS LIKELY TO BE A SUBSTITUTION FOR E. OTHER COMMON LETTERS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE INCLUDE T, A, O, I, N, S, AND H. THE CRYPTANALYST CAN USE THIS INFORMATION TO MAKE EDUCATED GUESSES ABOUT THE OTHER SUBSTITUTIONS IN THE CIPHERTEXT.

it took me around an hour, many combinations, after all it appeared, taht transpositon is necessary with 6 text, and the reverse is needed
